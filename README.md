# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This R script code cleans data obtained from wearable computing.
The code performs the following functions:

Merges the training and test sets to create one data set.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each observation measurement.

Each label is designated to match the appropriate values and each names relates to the perfumed task by the subjects.

The code also creates a clean data set from the download data.
The information regarding the data set can be found in the following web page:

Download the data from:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
Set the working directory where the file is located.
Then run the "run_analysis.R" code to obtain the tidy data set.
